/**
 * This library builds optimized versions of fst2 by grouping
 * different types of transitions together. The main points here are:
 *
 * 1) Test the input only once if you have same input with different outputs.
 *    Note that this practice should be discouraged anyway.
 *
 * 2) Replaces all transitions containing a pattern with a lemma by the
 *    comprehensive list of tokens that can match it, including case variants.
 *
 * 3) Discard lexical transitions that cannot match any token in the text.
 *
 * Note that steps 2 & 3 can be done safely even if the morphological mode is used,
 * because for that mode, the original fst2 states are used, unmodified.
 *
 * After step 3 is complete, some optimized states may have no outgoing transition
 * at all. We remove recursively all transitions to such states. If the optimized graph
 * becomes then empty, we also remove from all optimized states all transitions tagged
 * by this graph call, which can also lead to useless states with no outgoing transitions.
 * The process is repeated until there is no more removal.
