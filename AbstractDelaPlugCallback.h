/* use this header to define an abstract space for dictionary
   Reading and understanding AbstractFilePlugCallback.h before
   this using this file is suggested

An abstract dictionary space is a manager for persistent dictionary. This is a way to load
   a dictionary and reuse it without loading from disk (or virtual file space) on
   each use. This can save significant time with large dictionaries.

You must define a function which determines if a filename is member of this space

You must also define a set of callbacks, used by Unitex when a dictionary is needed.

The privateSpacePtr is a private value pertaining to the space that can be
  filled with a user-provided value. this value is passed to all callbacks.
This can be useful in avoiding carrying around global variable

The dictionary space manager must use load_INF_file and free_INF_codes to load
  the INF_codes* object(s) it will maintain.
  BIN objects are just arrays of unsigned char* with the raw content of the file.

/* this callback must return 1 is the filename is a member of the space

   Unitex will try other space (if any) or just load and free the dictionary
   using load_INF_file/loading BIN file by mapping - free_INF_codes/free mapped file

   It is very highly suggested this function return the same value for the
   both .inf and .bin files belonging to the the same dictionary.

   Note that Unitex will always uses dictionaries in read only mode, so they
   can be used several time and shared between thread */
