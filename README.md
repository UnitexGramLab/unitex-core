## Governance Model

Unitex/GramLab project decision-making is based on a community
meritocratic process, anyone with an interest in it can join the
community, contribute to the project design and participate in
decisions. The [Unitex/GramLab Governance
Model](http://governance.unitexgramlab.org) describes
how this participation takes place and how to set about earning merit
within the project community.

## Spelling

Unitex/GramLab is spelled with capitals "U" "G" and "L", and with
everything else in lower case. Excepting the forward slash, do not put
a space or any character between words. Only when the forward slash
is not allowed, you can simply write “UnitexGramLab”.

It's common to refer to the Unitex/GramLab Core as "Unitex", and to the
Unitex Project-oriented IDE as "GramLab". If you are mentioning the
distribution suite (Core, IDE, Linguistic Resources and others bundled
tools) always use "Unitex/GramLab".
